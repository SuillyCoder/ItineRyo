<p>This was originally a project I decided to do for my mother, since she likes planning for travel (especially in Japan). I thought it would be nice to help her out and put my full-stack knowledge to good use. Although the app is catered towards Japan, future versions of it could cater towards different places, depending on how well it goes.</p>

In the near future, I'll probably work on setting up instructions for how to set this up on your own device and have your version of this app up and running.</p>
